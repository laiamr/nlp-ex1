 woe to you, o'er earth and sea for the devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows the time is short let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast for it is a human number its number is six hundred and sixty-six i left alone, my mind was blank i needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind what did i see? can i believe that what i saw that night was real and not just fantasy? just what i saw, in my old dreams were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me? cos in my dreams, it's always there the evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair yeah night was black, was no use holding back cos i just had to see, was someone watching me? in the mist, dark figures move and twist was all this for real, or just some kind of hell? six-six-six, the number of the beast hell and fire was spawned to be released torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased as they start to cry, hands held to the sky in the night, the fires are burning bright the ritual has begun, satan's work is done six-six-six, the number of the beast sacrifice is going on tonight this can't go on, i must inform the law can this still be real, or just some crazy dream? but i feel drawn towards the chanting hordes seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes six-six-six, the number of the beast six-six-six, the one for you and me i'm coming back, i will return and i'll possess your body and i'll make you burn i have the fire, i have the force i have the power to make my evil take its course you'll take my life, but i'll take yours too you'll fire your musket, but i'll run you through so when you're waiting for the next attack you'd better stand, there's no turning back the bugle sounds, the charge begins but on this battlefield, no one wins the smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath as i plunge on into certain death oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh the horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run the mighty roar of the russian guns and as we race towards the human wall the screams of pain as my comrades fall we hurdle bodies that lay on the ground and the russians fire another round we get so near, yet so far away we won't live to fight another day oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh we get so close, near enough to fight when a russian gets me in his sights he pulls the trigger and i feel the blow a burst of rounds takes my horse below and as i lay there, gazing at the sky my body's numb and my throat is dry and as i lay forgotten and alone without a tear, i draw my parting groan oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i am a man who walks alone and when i'm walking a dark road at night, or strolling through the park when the light begins to change i sometimes feel a little strange a little anxious when it's dark fear of the dark, fear of the dark i have a constant fear that something's always near fear of the dark, fear of the dark i have a phobia that someone's always there have you run your fingers down the wall and have you felt your neck skin crawl when you're searching for the light? sometimes when you're scared to take a look at the corner of the room you've sensed that something's watching you fear of the dark, fear of the dark i have constant fear that something's always near fear of the dark, fear of the dark i have a phobia that someone's always there have you ever been alone at night thought you heard footsteps behind and turned around, and no one's there? and as you quicken up your pace you find it hard to look again because you're

they take me to the gallows pole the sands of time for me are running low running low, yeah when the priest comes to read me the last rites take a look through the bars at the last sights of a world that has gone very wrong for me can it be that there's some sort of error? hard to stop the surmounting terror is it really the end, not some crazy dream? somebody please tell me that i'm dreaming it's not easy to stop from screaming but words escape me when i try to speak tears fall, but why am i crying? after all, i'm not afraid of dying don't i believe that there never is an end? as the guards march me out to the courtyard somebody cries from a cell, "god be with you" if there's a god, why has he let me go? as i walk, my life drifts before me and though the end is near, i'm not sorry catch my soul, it's willing to fly away mark my words, believe my soul lives on don't worry now that i have gone i've gone beyond to seek the truth when you know that your time is close at hand maybe

night midnight all night! hear the rime of the ancient mariner see his eye as he stops one of three mesmerises one of the wedding guests stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea and the music plays on, as the bride passes by caught by his spell, and the mariner tells his tale driven south to the land of the snow and ice to a place where nobody's been through the snow, fog flies on the albatross hailed in god's name, hoping good luck it brings and the ship sails on, back to the north through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on the mariner kills the bird of good omen his shipmates cry against what he's done but when the fog clears, they justify him and make themselves a part of the crime sailing on and on and north across the sea sailing on and on and north till all is calm the albatross begins with its vengeance a terrible curse, a thirst has begun his shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner about his neck, the dead bird is hung and the curse goes on and on and on at sea and the thirst goes on and on for them and me "day after day, day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink" "there," calls the mariner "there comes a ship over the line but how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?" see... onward she comes onward she nears, out of the sun see... she has no crew she has no life; wait, but there's two death and she, life-in-death they throw their dice for the crew she wins the mariner and he belongs to her now then... crew one by one they drop down dead, two hundred men she... she, life-in-death she lets him live, her chosen one "one after one, by the star-dogged moon too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye four times fifty living men (and i heard nor sigh nor groan) with heavy thump, a lifeless lump they dropped down one by one." the curse, it lives on in their eyes the mariner, he wished he'd die along with the sea creatures but they lived on, so did he and by the light of the moon he prays for their beauty, not doom with heart, he blesses them god's creatures, all of them, too then the spell starts to break the albatross falls from his neck sinks down like lead into the sea then down in falls comes the rain hear the groans of the long-dead seamen see them stir and they start to rise bodies lifted by good spirits none of them speak, and they're lifeless in their eyes and revenge still is sought, penance starts again cast into a trance, and the nightmare carries on now the curse is finally lifted and the mariner sights his home spirits go from the long-dead bodies form their own light, and the mariner's left alone and then a boat came sailing towards him it was a joy he could not believe the pilot's boat, his son, and the hermit penance of life will fall onto him and the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea and the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins the mariner's bound to tell of his story to tell this tale wherever he goes to teach god's word by his own example that we must love all things that god made and the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man and the tale goes on and on and on and on from the coast of gold across the seven seas i'm travelin' on far and wide but now it seems i'm just a stranger to myself and all the things i sometimes do it isn't me but someone else i close my eyes and think of home another city goes by in the night ain't it funny how it is? you never miss it till

night wandering in the everglades i'd one drink, but no more i was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight gazing up at the stars not aware of a presence so near to me watching my every move feeling scared, and i fell to my knees as something rushed me from the trees took me to an unholy place and that is where i fell from grace then they summoned me over to join in with them to the dance of the dead into the circle of fire, i followed them into the middle, i was led as if time had stopped still, i was numb with fear but still, i wanted to go and the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me as i walked onto the coals then i felt i was in a trance and my spirit was lifted from me and if only someone had the chance to witness what happened to me and i danced, and i pranced, and i sang with them all had death in their eyes lifeless figures; they were undead, all of them they had ascended from hell as i danced with the dead, my free spirit was laughing and howling down at me below, my undead body just danced the circle of death until the time came to reunite us both my spirit came back down to me i didn't know if i was alive or dead as the others all joined in with me by luck, then a skirmish started and took the attention away from me when they took their gaze from me was the moment that i fled i ran like hell, faster than the wind but behind i did not glance one thing that i did not dare was to look just straight ahead when you know that your time has come around you know you'll be prepared for it say your last goodbyes to everyone drink and say a prayer for it when you're lying in your sleep when you're lying in your bed and you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead when you're lying in your sleep when you're lying in your bed and you wake from your dreams

brandy and cigars grey lady, giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms the millionth chance, they laughed to take down his majesty's craft "to india", they say, "magic carpet, float away" an october fateful day mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew the morning sunrise, red before the blue hanging at the mast, waiting for command his majesty's airship, the r101 she's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies for all you unbelievers, the titanic fits inside drumroll tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun never tested with the fury, with the beating yet to come the fury yet to come in the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the west the coxswain stared into the plunging weatherglass we must go now, we must take our chance with fate we must go now, for a politician, he can't be late the airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch but the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch she never flew at full speed, a trial never done her fragile outer cover, her achilles would become an achilles yet to come sailors of the sky, a hardened breed loyal to the king and an airship creed the engines drum, the telegraph sounds release the cords that bind us to the ground said the coxswain, "sir, she's heavy, she'll never make this flight" said the captain, "damn the cargo! we'll be on our way tonight" groundlings cheered in wonder as she backed off from the mast baptizing them her water from the ballast fore and aft now she slips into our past fighting the wind as it rolls you feeling the diesels that push you along watching the channel below you lower and lower into the night lights are passing below you northern france asleep in their beds storm is raging around you "a million to one," that's what he said reaper standing beside her with his scythe cuts to the bone panic to make a decision experienced men asleep in their graves her cover is ripped and she's drowning rain is flooding into the hull bleeding to death and she's falling lifting gas is draining away "we're down, lads," came the cry, bow plunging from the sky three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die the flares to guide her path ignited at the last the empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past just ashes at the last here lie their dreams as i stand in the sun on the ground where they built and the engines did run to the moon and the stars, now what have we done? oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on dreams live on, dreams live on, on now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east the empire of the clouds may rest in peace and in a country churchyard laid head to the mast eight and forty souls who came to die in france love is a razor, and i walked the line on that silver blade slept in the dust with his daughter eyes red with the slaughter of innocence and i will pray for her i will call her name out loud i would bleed for her if i could only see her now living on a razor's edge balancing on a ledge living on

scared to fall asleep again in case the dream begins again someone chasing, i cannot move standing rigid, a nightmare's statue what a dream, when will it end and will i transcend? restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil one nightmare ends, another fertile it's getting to me, so scared to sleep but scared to wake now, in too deep even though it's reached new heights i rather like the restless nights it makes me wonder, makes me think "there's more to this, i'm on the brink" it's not the fear of what's beyond it's just that i might not respond i have an interest, almost craving but would i like to get too far in? it can't be all coincidence too many things are evident you tell me you're an unbeliever spiritualist? well, me, i'm neither wouldn't you like to know the truth of what's out there, to have the proof? and find out just which side you're on where would you end? in heaven or in hell? argh! oh! help me, help me to find my true self without seeing the future save me, save me from torturing myself, even within my dreams, ow! there's got to be just more to it than this or tell me, why do we exist? i'd like to think that when i die i'd get a chance, another time and to return and live again reincarnate, play the game again and again and again and again in a foreign field, he lay lonely soldier, unknown grave on his dying words, he prays tell the world of passchendaele relive all that he's been through last communion of his soul rust your bullets with his tears let me tell you 'bout his years laying low in a blood-filled trench killing time till my very own death on my face, i can feel the falling rain never see my friends again in the smoke, in the mud and lead smell the fear and the feeling of dread soon be time to go over the wall rapid fire and the end of us all whistles, shouts, and more gunfire lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire battlefield: nothing but a bloody tomb be reunited with my dead friends soon many soldiers, eighteen years drown in mud, no more tears surely a war no one can win killing time about to begin home, far away from the war, a chance to live again home, far away but the war, no chance to live again the bodies of ours and our foes the sea of death, it overflows in no-man's-land, god only knows into jaws of death, we go crucified as if on a cross allied troops, they mourn their loss german war propaganda machine such before has never been seen swear i heard the angels cry pray to god no more may die so that people know the truth tell the tale of passchendaele cruelty has a human heart every man does play his part terror of the men we kill the human heart is hungry still i stand my ground for the very last time gun is ready as i stand in line nervous wait for the whistle to blow rush of blood and over we go blood is falling like the rain its crimson cloak unveils again the sound of guns can't hide their shame and so we die in passchendaele dodging shrapnel and barbed wire running straight at the cannon fire running blind as i hold my breath say a prayer, symphony of death as we charge the enemy lines a burst of fire and we go down i choke a cry, but no one hears feel the blood go down my throat home, far away from the war, a chance to live again home, far away but the war, no chance to live again home, far away from the war, a chance to live again home, far away but the war, no chance to live again
