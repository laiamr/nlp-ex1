is lost and nothing gained\nSometimes, things ain't what they seem\n\nNo brave new world\nNo brave new world\nNo brave new world\nNo brave new world\n\nNight and day, I scan horizon, sea, and sky\nMy spirit wanders endlessly\nUntil the day will dawn and friends\nFrom home discover why\nHear me calling, rescue me\n\nSet me free\nSet me free\nLost in this place\nAnd leave no trace\nSee Iron Maiden
